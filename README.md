L4D2 server for Docker
======================

Simple Left 4 Dead 2 Docker server with SourceMod and Left 4 Downtown.  Work in progress.

# Installation

1. Tune `cfg/server.cfg` and `sourcemod/admins_simple.ini` to your liking.  Be sure to change the passwords!
2. Run `buildRun.sh`.  The first run will download L4D2, which is about 8GB, and so may take a while.
